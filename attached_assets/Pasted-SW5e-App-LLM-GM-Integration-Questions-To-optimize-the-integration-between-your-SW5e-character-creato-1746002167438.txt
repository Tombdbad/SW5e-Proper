SW5e App-LLM GM Integration Questions
To optimize the integration between your SW5e character creator application and the LLM-powered GM system, I'd like to clarify the following:
Application Integration Specifics

State Synchronization:

How frequently do you plan to update game state between the app and LLM? (Every action, every round, only at significant events?)
What's the expected volume of state data per update (approximate byte size)?
How will you handle desynchronization if the LLM misinterprets a state change request?


Terrain & Positioning System:

What's the max grid size you're planning to support in the ASCII terrain representation?
Are you representing 3D terrain with multiple height levels? If so, how?
How detailed do you want the dynamic elements (e.g., doors, moving objects) reflected in terrain updates?


Persistence & History:

How will session history be stored between interactions?
How much context from previous exchanges should the LLM retain?
Will you implement "save states" or checkpoints that can be returned to?


Performance Considerations:

What's your target response time for LLM interactions?
Have you established a token budget for each LLM exchange?
What's your fallback plan if an LLM response exceeds token limits?



Technical Implementation Questions

Parsing & Serialization:

Are you using a specific library or custom code for parsing LLM responses?
How strict should the parsing be with formatting errors from the LLM?
What validation will you perform on state changes before applying them?


UI Flow:

Will the user directly interact with the LLM, or will all communication be mediated by your app?
How will errors in parsing or invalid state changes be presented to the user?
Are you planning a specialized UI component for copied LLM content vs. regular text input?



SW5e Game Mechanics Integration

Combat System:

How granular will combat mechanics be in state exchanges? (Initiative tracking, conditions, concentration, etc.)
Will powers/abilities be represented by IDs or descriptive text in exchanges?
How will you handle conditional effects that depend on previous actions?


Force/Tech Powers:

How will Force and Tech powers be represented in state exchanges?
Will power slots/points tracking be handled automatically or require LLM validation?
How will you represent area-of-effect powers on the terrain grid?


NPC Management:

How will NPCs be tracked in the state data?
Will the LLM be responsible for NPC creation, or will they come from pre-defined data?
How will NPC stat blocks be compressed for efficient state transfer?



Compiler Enhancement Opportunities

Code Generation:

Could your compiler generate specialized parsers based on your schema definitions?
Are there opportunities for automatic state diff generation to minimize data transfer?


Validation & Type Safety:

Could you leverage your TypeScript types to validate LLM responses at runtime?
Would it be valuable to generate JSON Schema from your TypeScript interfaces for LLM validation?


Optimization Techniques:

Could your compiler create optimized serialization/deserialization routines for game state?
Would compression techniques specific to your data structures be beneficial?
