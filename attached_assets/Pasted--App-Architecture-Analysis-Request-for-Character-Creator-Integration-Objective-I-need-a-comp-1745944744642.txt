# App Architecture Analysis Request for Character Creator Integration

## Objective
I need a comprehensive analysis of my application's architecture and database structure to integrate a new "character creator" feature that will work seamlessly with the existing codebase and data model.

## Essential Information to Provide

### 1. Overall Application Structure
- Identify the main directories and their purposes
- Detail the application's entry points
- Explain the application's runtime configuration
- Describe the overall architectural pattern (MVC, microservices, etc.)
- List key application dependencies and libraries

### 2. Database Structure
- Provide a complete schema of all existing tables and their relationships
- Identify primary/foreign key relationships
- Detail all columns, data types, and constraints
- Explain any existing database indexes or optimization strategies
- Map out how data flows through the application

### 3. Relevant Data Models
- Identify any existing models related to users, characters, or game entities
- Explain how these models are structured and interconnected
- Detail validation rules applied to these models
- Describe how these models interact with the database

### 4. Authentication System
- Explain how users are authenticated
- Detail how user sessions are managed
- Describe permission and role systems
- Explain how character ownership would be associated with users

### 5. Frontend Architecture
- Identify UI frameworks or libraries used
- Explain component structure and state management
- Detail existing UI patterns for forms and data visualization
- Describe routing and navigation systems

### 6. Backend API Structure
- Map out existing API endpoints and their purposes
- Detail request/response formats and conventions
- Explain error handling strategies
- Describe any API versioning or documentation systems

### 7. Development Workflow
- Explain how new features are normally integrated
- Describe testing frameworks and practices
- Detail any CI/CD processes
- Explain environment management (development, staging, production)

## Format Requirements
- Present a comprehensive technical analysis formatted for easy reference
- Include code snippets of critical implementation patterns
- Provide visual diagrams of database relationships where helpful
- Organize information hierarchically with clear section headers
- Focus on providing factual details rather than opinions or suggestions

## Additional Context
The "character creator" feature will need to allow users to:
1. Create new character profiles
2. Customize character attributes and appearances
3. Save characters to the database
4. Associate characters with user accounts
5. Retrieve and edit existing characters

Please analyze the codebase thoroughly so I can understand how to integrate this new feature while maintaining consistency with existing patterns and optimizing performance with your current database structure.
