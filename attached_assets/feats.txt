Feat 1: Armor Expert    

Feat Name: Armor Expert
Prerequisites: Strength 13 or Dexterity 13 or Constitution 13 (This prerequisite is inferred from the standard D&D 5e feats that Armor Expert consolidates. The specific requirement in SW5e should be verified in the official Player's Handbook).
Benefits: This feat grants proficiency in light armor, medium armor, heavy armor, and shields. The consolidation of these proficiencies into a single feat reflects an intention within the SW5e design to streamline character progression for martial characters, potentially allowing them to invest in other feats earlier in their development. This approach contrasts with the standard D&D 5e rules, where acquiring proficiency in all armor types typically requires multiple feat selections.
Feat 2: Augmented Cyborg    

Feat Name: Augmented Cyborg
Prerequisites: Any ability score, Type: beast or humanoid.
Benefits: The specific benefits of this feat are not detailed in the provided snippets and would require consultation of the "Wretched Hives" sourcebook or the official SW5e website. However, the existence of this feat indicates a deliberate integration of cybernetic enhancements into the SW5e mechanics. This acknowledges the prevalence of cyborgs in the Star Wars universe and provides a dedicated option for players wishing to embody such characters, likely granting advantages related to their technological augmentations.
Feat 3: Customized Droid    

Feat Name: Customized Droid
Prerequisites: Any ability score, Type: droid.
Benefits: Similar to Augmented Cyborg, the precise benefits of this feat are not available in the provided information. These details are likely found in the "Wretched Hives" sourcebook. The creation of this feat underscores the unique considerations for droid characters within SW5e. It suggests that droids have distinct customization paths and potential benefits that differ from organic characters, reflecting their mechanical nature and varied programming.
Feat 4: Empathic    

Feat Name: Empathic
Prerequisites: None explicitly stated.
Benefits: This feat increases the character's Wisdom score by 1, to a maximum of 20. It also grants proficiency in the Insight skill, or expertise if the character is already proficient. Additionally, the character can use a bonus action to attempt to gain insight about a humanoid within 30 feet that they have observed for at least one minute by making a Wisdom (Insight) check against the target's Passive Deception. A successful check grants advantage on one attack roll or ability check against the target until the end of the character's turn, and any saving throws provoked by these checks are made at disadvantage by the target. This feat enhances both passive perception and active social interaction, providing a tactical edge in understanding and potentially influencing others.
Feat 5: Fell Handed    

Feat Name: Fell Handed
Prerequisites: None explicitly stated.
Benefits: This feat grants proficiency with the handaxe, battleaxe, greataxe, warhammer, and maul. When using these weapons, the character gains a +1 bonus to attack rolls. If the character has advantage on a melee attack roll with one of these weapons and hits, they can attempt to knock the target prone if the lower of the two d20 rolls would also hit. If the character has disadvantage on a melee attack roll with one of these weapons and misses, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to the character's Strength modifier (minimum 0) if the higher of the two d20 rolls would have hit. When making an opportunity attack with one of these weapons and hitting a creature wielding a shield, the shield's AC bonus is negated until the end of the creature's next turn. This feat provides a versatile set of benefits for characters specializing in these common martial weapons, enhancing both their offensive capabilities and tactical options.
Feat 6: Flail Mastery    

Feat Name: Flail Mastery
Prerequisites: None explicitly stated.
Benefits: This feat grants a +1 bonus to attack rolls made with a flail. As a bonus action, the character can prepare to sweep over shields, gaining a +2 bonus to attack rolls with a flail against shielded targets until the end of the turn. When the character hits with an opportunity attack using a flail, the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + proficiency bonus + Strength modifier) or be knocked prone. This feat specifically enhances the use of the flail, making it a more strategically viable weapon with advantages against shielded opponents and the ability to control enemy movement.
Feat 7: Force Resistance    

Feat Name: Force Resistance
Prerequisites: Increase Strength, Wisdom, or Charisma by 1, to a maximum of 20.
Benefits: When a creature attempts to move the character against their will using a force power, the maximum distance the character can be moved is halved. The character also has advantage on saving throws made to avoid force damage. This feat directly addresses the unique threats posed by Force users in the Star Wars setting, providing significant defensive benefits against their powers. The ability score improvement further enhances the feat's value.
Feat 8: Legendary Strength    

Feat Name: Legendary Strength
Prerequisites: None explicitly stated beyond the benefit of increasing Strength, Wisdom, or Charisma by 1, to a maximum of 20.
Benefits: This feat grants proficiency in Strength saving throws, or expertise if already proficient. The character ignores the two-handed property of weapons they are proficient with. When the character misses with a melee weapon attack, the target takes damage equal to the character's Strength modifier, of the same type as the weapon's damage. This feat significantly enhances a character's physical capabilities, allowing for greater weapon versatility and consistent damage output, even on missed attacks.
Feat 9: Lightning Reflexes    

Feat Name: Lightning Reflexes
Prerequisites: Increase your Dexterity, Constitution, or Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
Benefits: This feat grants proficiency in Dexterity saving throws, or expertise if already proficient. Weapons that lack the two-handed or special properties are considered to have the finesse property for the character. Opportunity attacks made against the character have disadvantage. This feat enhances agility and defensive capabilities, making the character more mobile and less vulnerable to opportunity attacks, while also expanding the range of weapons that can benefit from Dexterity.
Feat 10: Unbreakable Fortitude    

Feat Name: Unbreakable Fortitude
Prerequisites: Increase your Constitution score by 1 to a maximum of 20.
Benefits: This feat grants proficiency in Constitution saving throws, or expertise if already proficient. Enhanced healing effects restore a minimum amount of hit points equal to half the character's level plus their Constitution modifier, up to the effect's maximum. The character can add their Constitution modifier to death saving throws. This feat provides a significant increase in survivability through improved resilience and enhanced healing.
Feat 11: Wise Mind    

Feat Name: Wise Mind
Prerequisites: Increase your Wisdom score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
Benefits: This feat grants proficiency in Wisdom saving throws, or expertise if already proficient. Creatures within 60 feet of the character have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide from them. As an action, the character can sense the presence of illusions and other deceptive effects within 30 feet, with a limited use requiring a short or long rest to replenish. This feat enhances mental resilience and awareness, improving the character's ability to detect hidden threats and resist mental manipulation.
Feat 12: Charismatic Presence    

Feat Name: Charismatic Presence
Prerequisites: Increase your Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
Benefits: This feat grants proficiency in Charisma saving throws, or expertise if already proficient. While conscious, the character can allow up to five friendly creatures within 30 feet to gain a bonus to one Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw equal to the character's Charisma modifier, with a limited use per short or long rest. As an action, the character can attempt to distract up to five creatures within 30 feet, imposing disadvantage on their Wisdom (Perception) checks against creatures other than the character on a failed Wisdom saving throw. This feat enhances social influence and provides support for allies, making the character a more effective leader and manipulator.
Feat 13: Double-Weapon Casting    

Feat Name: Double-Weapon Casting
Prerequisites: None explicitly stated.
Benefits: This feat allows the character to engage in Two-Weapon Fighting when taking the Cast a Power action and casting a power that requires a weapon attack. This suggests a synergy between martial combat and power usage, allowing for a more fluid and versatile combat style. The specifics of "Cast a Power" and "Two-Weapon Fighting" in this context would need to be further examined within the SW5e rules.
Feat 14: Two-Weapon Casting    

Feat Name: Two-Weapon Casting
Prerequisites: None explicitly stated.
Benefits: This feat expands on Double-Weapon Casting by allowing the character to engage in Two-Weapon Fighting even with one-handed melee weapons that lack the light property, specifically when taking the Cast a Power action and casting a power that requires a weapon attack. This provides even greater flexibility in combining martial and power-based combat, allowing for the use of more powerful weapon combinations.
Feat 15: Dutifully Deployed    

Feat Name: Dutifully Deployed
Prerequisites: Background-eligible.
Benefits: This feat grants an immediate rank in a deployment, which is likely a specific role or function within a starship crew as detailed in the Starships of the Galaxy expansion. This rank does not count towards the character's total number of ranks. This feat is tailored for campaigns with a significant starship component, allowing characters to immediately contribute to spacefaring activities.
Feat 16: Adaptable Fading    

Feat Name: Adaptable Fading
Prerequisites: None explicitly stated.
Benefits: This feat allows the character a limited ability to swap saving throws using the Fortitude (Constitution/Strength), Reflex (Dexterity/Intelligence), and Will (Wisdom/Charisma) categories. It also grants a limited-use bonus to specific attack rolls. The precise mechanics of these benefits require further research into the feat's full description. This feat introduces a layer of tactical flexibility, allowing the character to potentially leverage their stronger ability scores for crucial saving throws and gain an edge in combat with the attack roll bonus.
Feat 17: Flexible Rending    

Feat Name: Flexible Rending
Prerequisites: None explicitly stated.
Benefits: Similar to Adaptable Fading, this feat provides a limited amount of saving throw swapping within the Fortitude, Reflex, and Will categories and a limited-use bonus to specific attack rolls. The exact differences in mechanics compared to Adaptable Fading are not detailed in the provided information. The existence of multiple such feats suggests a design intent to offer players varied options for enhancing their character's adaptability.
Feat 18: Versatile Withering    

Feat Name: Versatile Withering
Prerequisites: None explicitly stated.
Benefits: Completing the series with Adaptable Fading and Flexible Rending, this feat also allows for limited saving throw swapping within the three categories and grants a limited-use bonus to specific attack rolls. The specific variations in mechanics compared to the other two feats in this series would require further examination. This trio of feats allows for fine-grained customization of a character's reactive and offensive capabilities.
Feat 19: Muscled Menace    

Feat Name: Muscled Menace
Prerequisites: None explicitly stated in the snippet, but likely species-related.
Benefits: This feat allows a species to partially mimic a creature of one size category higher, granting the "Oversized" special trait. The mechanical implications of the "Oversized" trait, such as potential benefits to carrying capacity or weapon usage, would need to be researched further. This feat provides a unique way for smaller characters to gain some of the advantages of larger creatures.
Feat 20: Dual Wielder (From Myself)    

Feat Name: Dual Wielder (From Myself)
Prerequisites: None explicitly stated.
Benefits: This modified version of Dual Wielder grants a +1 bonus to AC while wielding a separate melee weapon in each hand. It allows two-weapon fighting even with non-light one-handed melee weapons and enables drawing or stowing two one-handed weapons as a single action. Additionally, while wielding two weapons, the character's critical strike range increases by 1. This modification enhances the standard Dual Wielder feat, making dual-wielding a more potent offensive option.
Feat 21: Great Weapon Fighter (From Myself)    

Feat Name: Great Weapon Fighter (From Myself)
Prerequisites: None explicitly stated.
Benefits: On a critical hit with a melee weapon or when reducing a creature to 0 hit points with one, the character can make one melee weapon attack as a bonus action. Before making a melee attack with a heavy weapon the character is proficient with, they can choose to take a -5 penalty to the attack roll to add +10 to the damage. Alternatively, they can choose to gain a +1 to their critical strike range on all melee weapon attacks. This modified feat offers both increased action economy and a choice between higher damage output or an increased chance of critical hits for great weapon users.
Feat 22: Keen Mind (Inspired by Dawnforged Cast)    

Feat Name: Keen Mind (Inspired by Dawnforged Cast)
Prerequisites: None explicitly stated.
Benefits: This expanded version of Keen Mind increases the character's Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20. It retains the standard benefits of always knowing direction and time, and accurately recalling recent events. Additionally, as an action, the character can make an Intelligence check to determine specific traits of a creature, with the DC based on the creature's challenge rating. Success by 5 or more grants the party a bonus to attack and damage rolls, as well as saving throws against the creature's abilities. This modification transforms Keen Mind into a valuable tactical tool in combat.
Feat 23: Linguist (Inspired by Dawnforged Cast)    

Feat Name: Linguist (Inspired by Dawnforged Cast)
Prerequisites: None explicitly stated.
Benefits: This expanded Linguist feat increases the character's Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20. The character learns three languages and can create written ciphers. They gain advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against vocal component spells in languages they understand and can communicate basic ideas with any creature that has a language after spending at least one hour with them. This modification enhances both the utility and defensive capabilities of the feat.
Feat 24: Savage Attacker (From Myself)    

Feat Name: Savage Attacker (From Myself)
Prerequisites: None explicitly stated.
Benefits: This modified Savage Attacker increases the character's critical strike range with melee and thrown weapons by 1. Critical strikes with these weapons deal additional damage based on the character's level. Once per turn on a successful melee or thrown weapon attack, the character can choose to maximize a single weapon damage die, with a limited number of uses per rest. This modification significantly enhances the damage potential of weapon-based characters.
Feat 25: Sharpshooter (From Myself)    

Feat Name: Sharpshooter (From Myself)
Prerequisites: None explicitly stated.
Benefits: This modified Sharpshooter feat allows attacks at long range without disadvantage and ignores half and three-quarters cover. The character gains proficiency with a simple or martial ranged weapon. They can choose to take a -5 penalty to the attack roll with a ranged weapon to add +10 to the damage (once per round) or gain +1 to their critical strike range on all ranged weapon attacks. This modification provides both the standard benefits and a choice for further specialization in ranged combat.
