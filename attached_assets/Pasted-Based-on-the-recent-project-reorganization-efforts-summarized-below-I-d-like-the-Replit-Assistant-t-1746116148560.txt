Based on the recent project reorganization efforts summarized below, I'd like the Replit Assistant to provide specific suggestions and code examples for the following areas. Please focus on practical, actionable advice that I can directly implement within my Replit project.

**Summary of Reorganization Progress:**

‚úÖ Files Modified:
migrations/0002_add_missing_columns.sql
migrations/meta/_journal.json
client/src/components/CharacterCreation/PowersSelection.tsx
server/db.ts
client/src/lib/performance/monitor.tsx
.replit

‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Encountered & Fixed:
Database Schema Issues (missing 'subclass' and 'setting' columns)
React Component Issues (nested forms, type errors, duplicate keys in PowersSelection.tsx)
Build Issues (Fast Refresh compatibility with monitor.tsx, missing 'auto-zustand-selectors-hook' package)

üóÇÔ∏è Duplicate Definitions Resolved (sql and db in server/db.ts)

üîÅ Legacy/Redundant Code (db.ts cleanup)

üìã Build Status (Successful with React Router future flag warnings)

üß† Suggestions for Further Improvements:
React Structure Optimization (nested components in CharacterCreation, form structure)
Database Migration Strategy (versioning, schema integrity validation)
Performance Monitoring (refresh issues, optional in development)
Component Cleanup (duplicated PowersSelection components)

**Specifically, I'd like the Replit Assistant to address these points:**

1.  **React Structure Optimization:**
    * For the nested component structures within `client/src/components/CharacterCreation/`, can you suggest a potential refactoring pattern (e.g., composition, custom hooks) and provide a concise code example illustrating how this could be applied to a specific part of the existing structure?
    * Regarding the form structure in `client/src/components/CharacterCreation/PowersSelection.tsx`, what are some best practices to avoid nested `<form>` elements? Could you provide a simple example of how to restructure this component, perhaps using separate components or a different approach for managing form state?

2.  **Database Migration Strategy:**
    * Can you outline a basic but effective versioning system for our SQL migration files? What naming conventions or organizational structures would you recommend within the `migrations/` directory?
    * How can I implement a simple validation step on application startup (either in the backend or a build script) to check for the presence of critical columns like 'subclass' and 'setting' in their respective tables? Provide a conceptual example or a snippet of code that demonstrates this.

3.  **Performance Monitoring:**
    * Given that `client/src/lib/performance/monitor.tsx` caused Fast Refresh issues, what are some alternative approaches or configurations for performance monitoring in a React application that are more compatible with development workflows?
    * How can I conditionally enable or disable the performance monitoring features based on the environment (e.g., only active in production builds)? Provide a code snippet illustrating this conditional logic.

4.  **Component Cleanup:**
    * Considering the existence of potentially duplicated component files (like multiple `PowersSelection` components), what are some strategies for identifying and consolidating these? What are some clear indicators of a component that could be a candidate for reuse or refactoring?

Please provide concise and directly applicable suggestions with illustrative code examples where appropriate. The goal is to take the next steps in reorganizing the project based on these recommendations.
